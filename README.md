## Bank OCR Kata.
See Github Issue for details.

## Installation

Use [node.js v14](https://nodejs.org/en/). [The n version manager is recommended to manage your node.js versions.](https://github.com/tj/n)

If you know what you are doing, feel free to use your node.js version/JS runtime of choice.

I recommend using [entr](http://eradman.com/entrproject/) for quick and easy test-running/re-running-code-on-file-change during development.

This lets you do something like:
```
find *  | entr npm test
```
and your tests will re-run on any file change.

## Running the application
```
npm start
```

## Running tests
```
npm test
```
